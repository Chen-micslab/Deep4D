Phos_CCS is the phosphopeptide CCS dataset built by us, containing 54125 phosphopeptides. Training and test sets was randomly divided as 9 : 1.

Training and test set are shown as 'train' and 'test' file. Deep4D was trained with training set and then tested on the test set, the prediction results of test set was in the 'test_pre' file.
